# TODO
- Setting size of sprite/game object
    - Seperate world coordinates from scene coordinates
- Relative positioning of child nodes in SceneNode
    - Change SetPosition
- Manage life cycle of game objects (who's the owner)
    - Remove the bunch of shared_ptrs
- Event type handling compile time
- Customize events (e.g. shortcuts, mouse keys), handle most common events internally
- Seperate SFML specific implementations from abstract
- Use culling in rendering
- Make it easy to create grid
- Implement isometric projection
- Randomized tiled for equilancy classes (e.g. grass, ground)
- Engine generated dynamic tiles (e.g. water, fire)
- Dynamic lightning
