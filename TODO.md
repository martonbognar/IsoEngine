# TODO
- Setting size of sprite/game object
    - Scaling sprites
    - Seperate world coordinates from scene coordinates
    - User should see the same amount of objects (given aspect ratio) regardless of window size
    - Can set origin for objects
        - Individually for each object OR
            - By position or predefined type (e.g. center, top-left)
        - Globally for default
            - Only predefined type
- Manage life cycle of game objects (who's the owner)
    - Remove the bunch of shared_ptrs
- Event type handling compile time
- Customize events (e.g. shortcuts, mouse keys), handle most common events internally
    - E.g. move camera with arrows
    - Some EventHandlers with default unbound keys
    - Seperate triggers and handlers (can rebind certain handlers to new triggers)
- Add tile support
    - TileMap of given size using TileSize and TileSet (from textures)
        - Creates grid system
            - Optional grid features like edges
        - Can manipulate with cell coordinates
    - Randomized tiled for equilancy classes (e.g. grass, ground)
- Seperate SFML specific implementations from abstract
- Use culling in rendering
- Implement isometric projection
    - Use 3D coordinates for game objects
    - Define 3D world coords -> 2D scene coords mapping
        - Sprites use 2D
- Engine generated dynamic tiles (e.g. water, fire)
- Dynamic lightning
