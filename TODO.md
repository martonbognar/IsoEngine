# TODO
- Setting size of sprite/game object
    - Seperate world coordinates from scene coordinates
    - User should see the same amount of objects (given aspect ratio) regardless of window size
    - Streching should not pixelate the image
        - Use buffer render texture to draw to, display that in view
- Relative positioning of child nodes in SceneNode
    - Change SetPosition
    - Keep children attached to layers
- Manage life cycle of game objects (who's the owner)
    - Remove the bunch of shared_ptrs
- Event type handling compile time
- Customize events (e.g. shortcuts, mouse keys), handle most common events internally
- Seperate SFML specific implementations from abstract
- Use culling in rendering
- Make it easy to create grid
- Implement isometric projection
    - Use 3D coordinates for game objects
    - Define 3D world coords -> 2D scene coords mapping
        - Sprites use 2D
- Randomized tiled for equilancy classes (e.g. grass, ground)
- Engine generated dynamic tiles (e.g. water, fire)
- Dynamic lightning
